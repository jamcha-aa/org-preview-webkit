* About
  - Org-preview-webkit-mode is a simple program that gives an preview
    extension to org-mode. Anytime on saving, the built-in
    xwidget-webkit-browser shows an output image as html.
  - This program (v0.1) is slightly useless for realtime editing with
    preview screen. The xwidget-webkit always steals the cursor when
    viewing any file, which disturbs sequential writing.
  - This program is useful such situations:
    + Checking README output before submitting
    + Checking picture layouts in html
    + Just to see beautiful webkit output in emacs 25 :)

** Requirements

   xwidget-webkit-browser must be installed in emacs 25.1.1.

** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; auto-install
(auto-install-from-url "https://raw.github.com/jamcha-aa/auto-org-md/master/org-preview-webkit.el")
#+END_SRC

** .emacs.d/init.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-preview-webkit)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
  - In order to enable this function, *M-x org-preview-webkit*
  - Anytime you save, html preview appears in the other frame. Key
    bindings of the preview is the same with xwidget-webkit.
  - Press *"q"* key to back to the org file.
  - In the org frame, *M-x org-preview-webkit* toggles this function off.
